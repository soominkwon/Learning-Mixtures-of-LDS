# Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems
Implementation of Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems in Python. 

Author(s): Soo Min Kwon, Chinmaya Kausik, Nancy Wang, Sanal Shivaprasad

This implementation reproduces the figures in Chen and Poor's paper "Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems." If you have all the dependencies installed (i.e. matplotlib), then simply running the code should generate the figures.
